        <h4>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important</h4>
            <p>You put water in a cup and it becomes the cup.  You put water in a bottle and it becomes a bottle. You put water in a teapot… well you get the idea.  Responsive sites are fluid, melding and reshaping to the size of the device that the page is viewed on.  We use our smartphone and tablets for absolutely everything; internet surfing, social media and online shopping (when was the last time you used it to make a phone call). 

           Websites need to be mobile friendly, look as amazing and be as easy to use as their desktop counterpart.  And this is where <strong>responsive web design</strong> comes in.  Websites change the way they look depending on the size of the device without losing any of the functionality.  Users don’t have to zoom in or out to read text of find links.</p>

        <h4>What mobile first design is, and why it's important</h4>
             <p>By starting with mobile first design you have to opportunity to focus on what are the essentials for the website that based on user's goals.  Responsive design means you can minimize the elements and remove others to create a neat and clear page on mobiles and tablets. By starting with the mobile first, you focus on what is needed by the end user , how it will look, space is limited so every pixel counts.  Fluff can be added to the desktop once mobile is looking its best.</p>

        <h4>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why </h4>
             <p>The most challenge part of the wire frame layout to implement was getting the images in the correct places, after a while you realise that you are spending too much time being a perfectionist and its time to move on. Ill come back to it.   </p>

        <h4>What a wireframe is and why we use it </h4>
             <p>A wireframe is about functionality, it’s a simple sketch that sort of things you want on a page and they will be laid out. They are similar to mock up, showing the location of the navigation bar, text and images.   It’s a great way to visualise your website on a mobile and desktop and provides a format to work on.  Here is wireframes for the Index page of my blog on a mobile.</p>
