            <p>AFor those of you who were wondering where I disappeared to for four days; I was coding.  It was a chaotic journey but reached the goal at the end. Why so long, I will put it down to bad planning.  Just didn’t know where to start and instead of thinking the assignment through clearly, working on pseudocode  and searching for answers.  I just lept in with both feet, changed my mind on my approach more than one and ended up using JQuery because I found a function that suited what I was doing.   Learnings :  Next time we plan, plan and plan some more.  Look at the material we have been given to work with and don’t try and find quick and easy solutions. </p>

      <div class = "row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
            <p>Trying something new is probably my biggest downfall, I do it a lot instead of working through what I have.  Asking peers was probably the best technique, had become a little blind to my code and couldn’t see the wood for the trees.  I need to use pseudocode which would be similar to rubber ducky in its effectiveness, you don’t know you are lost if you don’t know where you are going.  Console.logging in this instance didn’t provide any solutions.  As always Google is your friend, but I need to be specific in my searches. </p>

            <p><strong>.map()</strong> are used in array’s. It is used to map to reference an existing array then create a new array containing changes.   The first array remains unchanged. </p>
            <p><strong>.filter()</strong> again, used in array’s, they produce an array with elements from the created by a function in the form of an array.  It is a group of processes based on an array.  The original array remains unchanged. </p>
          <p><strong>.reduce()</strong> is used to reduce an array to one value.
