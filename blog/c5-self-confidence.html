        <h4>Mindfulness vs Awareness</h4>
      <div class = "row">
        <div class="eight columns">
            <p>Self-awareness is introspective, its about understanding who you are and being aware of your own needs, desires, shortcomings and habits.  Just about everything that make you who you are.  By being aware of who you are and how you react to situations (“he really knows how to press my buttons”) makes it easier to control your reactions.  Being self aware means you have the ability to change things that you don’t like;  the same reaction to the same problem will result in the same outcome.  If you are aware of your reaction, you can change the outcome.</p>

            <p>Think of mindfulness is the ability to focus your attention on the present, this very moment,  and ignore all distractions. Its not about concentration but about experincing everything that is happening around us without passing judgement.  Once we’ve cut out the internal chatter we become a watcher of sense perception, thoughts and emotions as they happen without getting caught up in.</p>

       <h4> Journals</h4>
    <div class = "row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <p>I’ve done a bit of journaling, can’t say I am a regular though. It helps to put things in perspective, especially if you have that “stuck in a cave and there is no way out” feeling. Writing everything down seems to take the emotion out of the situation and you start dealing with facts instead of feelings. Funny thing is, you tend to be writing about your feelings at the time, weird how things work. I don’t particularly enjoy the exercise, its usually a last resort,  but find it helpful and should probably do it more.
