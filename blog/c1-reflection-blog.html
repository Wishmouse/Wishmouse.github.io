        <h4>It all depends on how you look at it.</h4>
            <p>Am into my first week of coding and feeling a bit overwhelmed, which is totally expected, who wouldn't be. Inbetween those moments of feeling confused are those where I have acheivements.  Learning isn't about knowing everyting off the bat, learning is all about making mistakes,  being creative and sticking your neck out.  <em>If you are passionate you will succeed. </em>.  And that's the Dev Academy experience.</p>

            <p>Its about being passionate and having a good dose of hunger that makes you want to work harder.  Not because you have to but because you are <em>inspired</em> to.  My concern is will I ifit in, will I keep up with my class and will I be able to add value .  All those little ego driven concerns. The simple answer: of course I will.  My learning style is based around experince, its where I acheive the most.  Sure, remote learning makes me nervous, but its a new experience. </P>
