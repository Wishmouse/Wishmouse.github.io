        <h4>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
      <div class = "row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
            <p>Lets run through the functions of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to explain it better:
              We use <strong>HTML</strong> to create the actual content of the page, this means in HTML you define the basic structure and the contents of a website, like written text and headers.  In a Windows context, thing of HTML as Notepad. <strong>CSS</strong> is responsible for the design of the webpage, how everything looks, like boarders and backgrounds, CSS makes the webpage look yummy. In a Windows context, thing of HTML as Word or PowerPoint.  So what does <strong>Javascript</strong> do, its responsible for everything that changes or is animated after the website is loaded, there is more scripting behind the scenes, it is heavy in formulas and processed.  You guessed it in Windows can be to Excel.  A website that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit, for example, is utilising Javascript to do the calculations.</p>

      <h4>Flows and Loops</h4>
            <p>The code in Javascript is processed in the order that it appears, makes sense,  Control flow, as the name suggests, controls the flow by break up ‘top to bottom’ process and allowing the programme to execute particular blocks of code.  This includes if statement, if-else and switch, you will remember If statements from Excel and the same concept applies. 
            Loops are a quick and easy way of doing things repeatedly, lets say you want to run the same code over and over again but teach time with a different value until a process has been completed.  By ‘completed’ this could be something like a set number of times eg. you internet banking password or until a true value is reached eg. entering your birthday to prove you are over 18.  </p>

      <h4>Arrays and Object laterals</h4>
            <p><em>Arrays have an order, Objects don’t</em>.

            Arrays are ordered lists and use numbered indexes.  Elements can be add to them, remove from them, ask for the a specific item in the list eg first or third eg.  create a list of fruit, now remove all of those that start with “F” (sorry feijoa and figs, you’re out).  There can even be a list of objects in an array.  
            In contrast to Arrays, we generally want to know if an Object contains a collection properties. A car would be an Object, it has a colour, weight and methods like start and stop.  </p>

      <h4>Explain functions</h4>
        <p>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.  I know you are thinking… “hmmm… this sounds like Excel”, Exactly!   So if you wanted to add, subtract or do an algorithm to work out the winning lotto numbers.  Functions would be how you would do it. The function is given a name for identification, with the instruction of what is to be action is located inside curly brackets {}.</p>
