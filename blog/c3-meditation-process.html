          <h4>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h4>
          <p>Honestly it didn’t affect the site redesign that much.  Time is precious at the moment which means I complete the task as quickly and simply as I can, while following the instructions and principles in the lesson.  My task is to finish the assignment by Friday of each week and if there is time on the weekend I get to tweak and pretty-fy.  I look at others blogs and am impressed with their achievements and inspired to give their ideas a try.</p>
          <h4>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?</h4>
          <p>Not a huge fan of mediation, I have read a lot about it, have friends swear by it and have had it recommended by medical professionals.  Sitting and trying to focus on not focussing for any length of time is a challenge, I have found other ways of cutting down the background chatter like running and swimming.  Both activities bring a sense of calm, you zone out, breath and your mind slowly drifts off into a meditative state.  The joys of being an active relaxer.</p>

        <h4>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</h4>
          <p>That it actively affects the composition of your brain and cuts down the blink speed.  That’s freaky stuff.</p>

        <h4>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
          <p> When distracted, take five breaths before acting on it.  Also, its perfectly okay to loose focus, once you've noticed, dismiss and refocus.</p>
