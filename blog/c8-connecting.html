The process that’s outlined in Search Inside Yourself is just the way I make friends and get to know people, being quite a social bunny it’s a natural process. </p>

            <p><em>Situation: </em> a colleague felt that she had not been consulted on when implementing changes to our CRM and was very vocal and disrespectful in in her argument.  Instead of speaking to the team leader she had the discussion with me instead.</p>

            <p><em>I am 100% correct: </em>   I wasn’t part of the team implementing the changes and was asked to sit in on their planning meeting as a consultant only to advise on any integration concerns.   I wasn’t responsible for planning or feasibility study, if you have a concern you need to address the team responsible for the changes.</p> 

            <p><em>They are 100% correct: </em>  You should have been consulted and the changes that have been implemented directly address.  As a consultant in the meeting you expected me to point out that not everybody had been consulted.</p>
