      <div class="col-4"><strong>HTML</strong> is the building-blocks of web pages.   HTML allows you to put images, text, videos, forms and other pieces of content together into a cohesive webpage. You can also tweak  words, resize images, and add links. Anything that you can read or view on this website is being presented to you (by way of a browser) with HTML.</div>
      <div class="col-4"><strong>CSS</strong> dictates your websiteâ€™s look and feel. Font size, font colour, font type, styling around images, page layout, mouse-over effects and more are all determined by CSS.</div>
      <div class="col-4"><strong>DOM</strong> provides a structured layout of the document (a tree) it defines how the text and images will be laid out on the page, it give the webpage structure.</div>
    </div>

      <div class="col-6">
            <ul>
        <li>HTML will be the furniture, ornaments and rugs.  </li>
        <li>CSS with be the colour scheme, style of the fittings and their size (eg. single chairs or a large couch).  </li>
        <li>DOM will be how the room is put together, how the items arranged in the room.</li>

       <div class="col-12"><strong>So what is BOXIFY</strong>
Everything on your webpage is arranged in boxes and boxifying you design lets you organise your page content into separate dedicated boxes for each specific section. When creating you page, you lay all the elements out and draw boxes around them to show how they will fit on a page.  The size of each box is in your complete control but it recommended to divide the page into rows with 12 columns, which makes 12 boxes, this give you the most flexibility in your layout.

      <div class="col-3"><strong>The Box Model</strong></div>
      <div class="col-6">The CSS box model is essentially a box that is around all HTML elements. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and then the actual.
There are four elements to the box model:

<div class="col-3"></div>
    </div>
     <div class="row">
      <div class="col-4"><em>Content</em> - The content of the box, where text and images appear</div>
      <div class="col-4"><em>Padding</em> - Clears an area around the content, it can be made larger or smaller leaving a gap between text and the border. The padding is transparent</div>
      <div class="col-4"><em>Border</em> - A border that goes around the padding and content. Borders can be given a colour / style</div>
      <div class="col-4"><em>Margin</em> - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent</div>
