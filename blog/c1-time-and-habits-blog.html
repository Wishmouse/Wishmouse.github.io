      <h2>Managing my moments</h2>
    <p>
      Turns out I am a <strong>C</strong>ertified <strong>P</strong>omodoro <strong>M</strong>aster.  Yes, wonder if I can add that to my CV... *taps chin in a thoughful manner*. Probably the best technique I have used to manage my work load, also makes it eaiser to say No to those projects you don't have time for.  Helps me get my head around what needs to be done, break tasks into managable chunks and then leap in with enthusiasm.  A great way to work out your billable time too, nobody likes a poor budgeter.

    <h2>Giving it a go</h2>
    <p>Love the "habit creating" approach.  Take a task, make it simple and match it up with something else.  The first habit I am going to create is drinking more water.  Seems silly but its on my new years resolution list!</P></div>
