How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
I want them to be inspired and experience an easy to read, easy to follow website that encourages the visitor to click through each page.  They must want to come often to see changes and updates to the layout and design and possibly copy a thing or two.  

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
1.  Formatting headers 1-4 so that they follow the same layout and progression
2.  Format the navigation bar so it more attractive
3.  Change the colour layout from pink to oranges an brown
4.  Add graphics on each page
5.  Format paragraphs
